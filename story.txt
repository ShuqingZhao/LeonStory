One day, Leon wake up earlier than usual, and Leon find out that there is no class today due to snow storm. So Leon decide to keep sleeping. What a lovely day!

Leon thought he's go nothin to do
but is that real?
ha! too young too simple sometimes naive!
he's got a cs project due that day
but he's got no idea
not until 2 hours before the due time
"oh my good Lord what am I gonna do"
Leon had no idea
neither do I
do you know?

Leon went to the CS Lab and met with a TA
The TA was very helpful and described the algorithm
that was needed to implement the restructuring function
for the RedBlackTree class. Leon submitted his program and got
an A+
