One day, Leon wake up earlier than usual, and Leon find out that there is no class today due to snow storm. So Leon decide to keep sleeping. What a lovely day!

Leon thought he's go nothin to do
but is that real?
ha! too young too simple sometimes naive!
he's got a cs project due that day
but he's got no idea
not until 2 hours before the due time
"oh my good Lord what am I gonna do"
Leon had no idea
neither do I
do you know?

Leon went to the CS Lab and met with a TA
The TA was very helpful and described the algorithm
that was needed to implement the restructuring function
for the RedBlackTree class. Leon submitted his program and got
an A+

After Leon left the lab
He found out he left his backback in the lab
When he went back to find it the lab is already closed because of the snow
Going back home have nothing to do
Leon suddenly realized he had a calc exam tommorrow
But all his study material is in his backpack
What is he gonna do?

Sudddenly, Leon wake up and find out all these are just dreams,
He check out the schedual and figure out there is no class today (this is real),
So Leon can keep sleeping and hope no nightmare anymore.
